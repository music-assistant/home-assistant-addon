# [2.7.0] - 17.12.2025

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This release adds mandatory authentication to the Music Assistant webserver.

 At first startup you will be greeted with a setup screen to create the (first) admin account, your data will be reserved. You need this account to login to Music Assistant directly from now on.

 Running as Home Assistant add-on? We will automatically log you in when using the built-in (Ingress) panel to access Music Assistant. The Home Assistant integration should also reconnect automatically, just ensure you run at least HA 2025.12.

 When you are not running the Music Assistant Server as an Home Assistant add-on, you will need to authenticate the Home Assistant integration - a button will show up in the Home Asssistant Settings/Integrations page.
